# P!tch - Android music player using Spotify API
## What is P!tch?
Titles must be self-descriptive so, as you've already read, yes, P!tch is an Android music player app whose goal is to be a skin for Spotify. I personally love music and use Spotify as my go-to music player and switching to another platform would be so tedious. I would have to re-save all my albums, re-make my playlists and look for my favourites artists again, taking so much of my time. Well, then why switch to my app? As P!tch will be using Spotify API, all our data will be requested directly to Spotify and my app will just be like a skin to Spotify. 
## Why P!tch?
Well, I really love designing and personally find Spotify a little bit overcomplicated for what it is. Why have things I don't even know if I will like in my front page? Why can't I choose what will be displayed on there? P!tch will be very friendly for those of us who like to organize all by ourselves and be able to personalize what we see, with a fresh new look.
## Who am I?
I haven't introduced myself yet, right? My name is Daniel Gracia, and I'm currently studying a Computer Science degree alongside a Videogame Development degree in San Jorge Univeristy, Zaragoza, Spain. This is my first individual non-academical related project, started in January 2020. With this project, I really expect to learn plenty of Android related stack, as that is my main interest at the moment. This is a long-term project so maybe I will not be so consistent in updating P!tch, but I'll try my best for P!tch to be as good as I can make it.
## Tech stack
For now, this is what I got:
- Kotlin: Front-end
*I know it is poor for now, but I will update as soon as I get to use more tech!*
