# Pitch music player - Android music player using Spotify API and SDK - Kotlin
Pitch is a music player for Spotify that uses Spotify's Web API and SDK to let the user listen to everything they have on their account while using a smoothly designed app (Pitch, of course). It is not that Spotify app is badly designed, but I personally don't find it being my cup of tea so, in order to learn Android development and Kotlin, I wanted to make this app.
This will be a side project of mine, as at the moment I'm studying a Computer Science degree alongside a Videogame Development degree.

## Stack
For now, this is all I got:
- Kotlin

## Resources
